# Get Started With Competitive Programming

Hi Programmers!

Lets Get Started.
The term CP that is Competitive Programming refers to sport of programming in which you along with fellow programmers round the globe compete for the best solution to the problem , that is , you program like an athlete to be the best.
The culture of CP has risen since a few years . Students who have interest in programming start practising with guidance from a very early age. But it is said No age is the right age for learning.

There are various programming websites that help you to build the knowledge and apply you best skills to solve the problem. They also organise various code sprints on an international level. Some of the sites are-
1. Codechef  (www.codechef.com)
2. Hackerrank (www.hackerrank.com)
3. Hackerearth (www.hackerearth.com)
4. Codeforces (www.codeforces.com)
5. Topcoder (www.topcoder.com)
6. Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ) (www.spoj.com)
7. A2OJ(By Ahmed Aly) (www.a2oj.com)
... and many more

Now comes the programming language part. It is said that "an average programmer thinks of syntax but a good programmer thinks of the algorithm!" . So keeping this in mind all these sites provide you the facility to code in any of the languages whose free compiler is available. So the level of comfortability is the thing one should not think of. You can code in any of the languages mentioned below-
1. C++
2. JAVA
3. C
4. Python
5. PHP
6. Perl
7. Java Script
... and many more 

Here in this world of CP you have to design the optimistic algorithms you can think of using some Defined Algos or using some algos to mix up and make a new one. You have to think a way of solving the problem and try to improve upon it by learning side by side.


Hope you find this start comfortable enough and move on to our next part of the purpose to keep yourself motivated.
